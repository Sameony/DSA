immutable: values are not changed, only the references
eg: a=3
b=3
#both will have same id
a=4
#a will now have different id
mutable (lists): values are changed
li=[1,2,3,4]
li2=li
#li2 will now point to same reference as that of li and hence change in li2 will reflect in li and vice versa
li2[3]=1
li will also become [1,2,3,1] because reference is same and value is changed
